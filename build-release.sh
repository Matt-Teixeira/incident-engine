# Release incident-engine: mirror THIS working tree to /opt/apps/<APP_NAME>,
# apply the #RELEASE: .env overrides, stamp the released commit, build as svc.
# Fleet paradigm — ported from data_acquisition's build-release.sh
# (data_acquisition/docs/migration_CLAUDE.md Part 1: "Clean-tree guard",
# "Release provenance").
#
# Flow:
#   1. Clean-tree guard      — refuse to release a dirty tree (untracked counts)
#   2. Mirror via tar-pipe   — working tree -> $DEST, with excludes
#   3. Transform .env        — apply #RELEASE:KEY=VALUE, strip markers
#   4. Stamp RELEASE_SHA     — into the DEPLOYED .env only (idempotent)
#   5. chown + build as svc  — image becomes incident-engine:svc

# copied by tar. This app's only gitignored bulk is the dev run logs.
# NOTE: '*-log.*.json' is deliberately narrow — a bare '*.json' would strip
# package.json / package-lock.json and break the release build. test/ and
# integration/ ship on purpose: they are small and the parity checks are run
# against the release copy after deploys.
